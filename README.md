# 🏘️ Real Estate Data Scraping and Analysis
## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate web scraping techniques to gather real estate data from multiple websites such as **Alonhadat.com**, **Bds.com**, and **Rever.vn**. After scraping the data, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the real estate market.

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. Data Scraping
We scrape the following information from multiple real estate websites:
- Property address
- Price
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Total area (m²)
- Property title and description
- Additional details such as nearby amenities and contact information
Each notebook demonstrates how to gather the data efficiently, handle pagination, and deal with challenges like missing data or inconsistent formats.
## 🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Estate-Scraping.git
```
Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Real-Estate-Scraping
```
Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells:
```bash
jupyter notebook alonhadat.ipynb
jupyter notebook bds.com.ipynb
jupyter notebook rever.ipynb
```
Ensure you have internet access while running the notebooks to allow for live data scraping.
