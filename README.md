# 🏘️ Real Estate Data Analysis Project

## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains an analysis of real estate data using Python. We perform data scraping, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the real estate market. Additionally, machine learning models are used to predict property prices based on available features.

## 🔍 Project Details
## 🏡 Data Scraping from Real Estate Websites
In the notebook rever.ipynb, we scrape real estate data from rever website using BeautifulSoup. The data includes:
- Property address.
- Price.
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- Total area.
- Property title and additional details.
## 🔄 Data Preprocessing
- Check Data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Handel outliers.
- Handel Normal Distribution.
- Normalize Data.
- Check Multicollinearity.
## 🧠 Machine Learning
We implement Linear Regression model to predict real estate prices based on features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Total area
- Property location
- Models used include:
## 🚀 How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-analysis.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd real-estate-analysis
```
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells:
```bash
jupyter notebook rever.ipynb
```
Ensure that the file Real_Estate_data.xlsx is in the same directory as the notebook for smooth execution.
